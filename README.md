**This Repository consist of 2 Logistic Regression file** : 
* If you want to read clearly step by step logistic Regression with pyspark and see the screenshot from my computer, you can open the `Logistic Regression with Pyspark (Code + Screenshot).ipynb` file
* If you are lazy to read and you only want to do coding,  just open the `Logistic Regression with Spark (Code  Only) .txt` file. Copy and Paste the code in your Spark.
